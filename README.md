ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @juliemattimoe

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using machine learning in order to automate daily tasks for my team!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) with Python for time series predictions and creating APIs using Flask.

:thread: When I'm not coding, I'm crafting! :yarn:
